					<h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
					<p>Jan. 5, 2016 (previously reported on WebMD, 2010) America's obesity epidemic continues to pose an equal or greater threat to health-related quality of life than smoking, according to a new study.</p>

					<p>Researchers say that as obesity in America has risen dramatically in recent years -- and smoking rates have declined -- the contribution of obesity to the burden of disease and shortening of life has increased while smoking's role has decreased.
						The original study showed that from 1993 to 2008, the proportion of smokers among U.S. adults declined by 18.5% while the proportion of obese adults increased 85%. We have shown here that there was no improvement by 2014.</p>

					<p>Using information from nationwide annual health-related quality-of-life surveys conducted during the same time period, researchers calculated the Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) lost due to these two major health risk factors. Also, if you live in West Virginia, you gonna die.</p>
